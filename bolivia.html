            Mr. Lyon successfully completed training and was sworn in as a Natural Resource/Environmental Education Volunteer on April 13th, 2007.  He was assigned to the environmental/natural disaster office within the Mayor’s Office in the Municipality of Yamparáez, Chuquisaca, Bolivia.   Mr. Lyon’s work was focused within the municipality, assisting local technicians and agronomists with community projects as well as working as an environmental educator with schools in four communities.</p>

            <p class="lead">Working with the mayor’s office in Yamparáez Mr. Lyon utilized GPS and GIS mapping technology to assist a variety of projects including location of mini-dams and irrigation ponds, expansion of electric utility lines to remote communities, community planning and development, watershed management, reforestation and construction of new roads. He also created an updated and accurate map of all existing roadways and communities found within the municipality.  Mr. Lyon trained several technical workers of the mayor’s office in the use of a GPS receiver and the transfer of spatial data form the GPS receiver to the computer.  Mr. Lyon was also working with Trees for the Future, an American NGO, to create two tree nurseries within the municipality when the Peace Corps program in Bolivia was suspended.</p>

            <p class="lead">Mr. Lyon also worked in schools in Yamparáez and three nearby communities organizing the students to start gardens. This project included teaching students, teachers and interested community members about composting, natural pesticides, vermicomposting, and nutrition.  He also organized women from the communities to prepare lunch for the students with vegetables harvested from the gardens.  In Yamparáez, Mr. Lyon organized an Eco-Club where the importance of protecting the environment was discussed and local environmental problems were addressed.  He also assisted with classes in basic computation in the local internet café in Yamparáez. Students were taught how to create Power Point presentations that dealt with environmental themes such as pollution and recycling. Mr. Lyon worked with the local NGO Biblioworks to help open and manage a community library in Yamparáez.  He assisted the librarian in coding books based on the Dewey Decimal system as well as with organizing and shelving.  He also used the library space to hold English classes bi-weekly and offered assistance with student’s homework.</p>

In April of 2008, Mr. Lyon hosted eight workshops in four community schools on the importance of recycling and reducing solid waste including a hands-on session where the students were able to practice the art of recycling paper.</p>
