            <p class="lead">For most of 2015 I had the unique opportunity to work at Peru’s <a href="http://www.sernanp.gob.pe/">Servicio Nacional de Áreas Protegidas por el Estado (SERNANP)</a> office in downtown Lima. My main duties as an Environmental Information Management Specialist involved helping design a geodatabase for storing and distributing SERNANP’s GIS data. Towards the end of my 1-year contract I got to break the monotony of office work when I was invited by the Wildlife Conservation Society to help deliver some hands-on training classes to Environmental Specialists from all around the country.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Peru’s Protected Natural Areas (ANPs) help preserve some of the more unique landscapes and vital natural resources for future generations to come. With more than 75 ANPs covering close to 20 million hectares, managing these vast and diverse areas can be a challenge. Spatial and field data collected by park guards plays an important role in tackling issues such as illegal mining and logging activities and is vital to wildlife monitoring. Getting this information from the remote corners of the country to the decision makers in Lima can be a monumental task. To facilitate this transfer of information SERNANP has been utilizing GIS and remote sensing as tools to help manage its ANPs, but a lack of funding has made it difficult to provide park employees with commercial GIS software.  As an alternative SERNANP has decided to embrace the open-source QGIS software. In order to help implement the use of QGIS part of my work involved designing a training course and manual to be used to teach ANP Specialists how to create and update their local data that they can then feed into a nation-wide database and map viewer.</p>

            <p class="lead">After months of editing and countless revisions to the manual I was finally able to present my work when my counterpart Ovidio Monzón Crespín and I delivered two QGIS training courses. The first took place in Lima on July 7th-10th with 18 participants and the second in Cuzco on July 21st-22nd with 7 participants. The attendees were mainly biologists and environmental specialists who came from various ANPs from all corners of the country.  Ovidio and I each took turns leading the exercises while the other tended the class to answer individual questions. All in all, I feel the courses were successful and it was a real joy for me to be able to share some of my knowledge of GIS. There are truly no words to describe the pleasure one receives to see a person’s eyes light up when they learn something new.</p>
